# This script tries to exec a terminal emulator by trying some known terminal
# emulators.
#
# We welcome patches that add distribution-specific mechanisms to find the
# preferred terminal emulator. On Debian, there is the x-terminal-emulator
# symlink for example.
#
# Invariants:
# 1. $TERMINAL must come first
# 2. Distribution-specific mechanisms come next, e.g. x-terminal-emulator
# 3. The terminal emulator with best accessibility comes first.
# 4. No order is guaranteed/desired for the remaining terminal emulators.
